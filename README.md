## MOVING AWAY FROM GITHUB

As Github is now a Microsoft product, I'm not going to use it, outside of
contributing to projects hosted on Github.

My actively maintained repos that were once mirrored on this site are now
private. They are still accessible through my Codeberg and git server.

Wanna check out my personal projects?

* [Codeberg](//codeberg.org/spitemim)
* [git.spitemim.xyz](//git.spitemim.xyz)

Also check out [my website](//spitemim.xyz).
