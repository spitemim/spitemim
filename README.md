## MOVING AWAY FROM GITHUB

As Github is now a Microshit product, I'm not going to use it, outside of
contributing to projects hosted on Github.

Wanna check out my personal projects?

* [Codeberg](//codeberg.org/spitemim)
* [git.spitemim.xyz](//git.spitemim.xyz)

Also check out [my website](//spitemim.xyz).
